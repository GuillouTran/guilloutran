## Howdy, mate!

I'm an aspiring CS student from Vietnam. I have been inspired to code ever since I was 12! I'm currently living in France and I have also previously lived in the United States!

Besides coding, I enjoyed reading and of course, procastinating. Other hobbies includes: listening to shitty music and annoy everybody with my ukulele. Also, I sometimes casually write short blog and rant on stuff on my personal blog at: [guilloutran.com](https://blog.guilloutran.com)
